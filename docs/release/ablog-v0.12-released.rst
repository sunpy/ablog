ABlog v0.12 is released with the main focus being retemplating the library.

``pyproject.toml`` is now the source of package infomation.
``ruff`` has been widely deployed to fix any underlying issues found.

Ablog also got parts of its internal process rewritten to follow modern sphinx.

We dropped support for Python 3.9 and Sphinx 5.X.Y.
