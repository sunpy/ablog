ABlog v0.8.0 is released with additions and changes:

  * Added ``-a`` argument to :ref:`ablog build <build>` command, with which
    you can force rewriting all pages when rebuilding your project. Default is
    writing only pages that have changed.

  * Added ``-f`` argument to :ref:`ablog deploy <deploy>` command, with which
    you can amend to latest commit to keep GitHub pages repository small.
    Thanks to `uralbash`_ for this contribution.

  * Added ``-p`` argument to :ref:`ablog deploy <deploy>` command, with which
    you can specify the path to your GitHub pages repository, i.e.
    ``username.github.io``.

  * Changed :confval:`fontawesome_link_cdn` to be a string argument to enable
    linking to desired version of `Font Awesome`_. Thanks to `Albert Mietus`_
    for this contribution.

  * Post lists font style is now controlled through CSS. Thanks to
    `Albert Mietus`_ for this contribution as well.

  * Fixed internal link resolution issue that affected atom feeds of
    collections, i.e. feeds of posts under a category, tag, or author.
